Heyo!

I haven't written here for a while.
I won't say the clichet "I've been busy", because if I had time to watch re-watch all seasons of Breaking Bad, I had time to write a blog post.
I just didn't feel like it, I guess.

I am realising now that this is the first time I am writing a non-technical blog post in my blog. Hope you don't mind.

## Work

I've been busy on a few things lately. I've been on a tight schedule at work, but I have been enjoying it.

At work the company is growing, and I've been working on a few things to help the company scale. Namely, I've been:

- Creating flexible solutions that allow different business models with different requirements to work seamlessly on the same application
- Learning and creating E2E tests with Playwright (so far, love it: the tooling is awesome)
- Involved more in the end-to-end process of features

I believe this is all I can say about work without getting into trouble.

## Side-project

I'm currently working on only one side project: [SportsIn](https://sportsin.app/). I included the commercial website link so you can check it out.

Lately I've been trying to push my applications to the App Store and Google Play, which hasn't been easy: lots of trial-and-error, but I'm getting there.
I had no idea that it was so much trouble to publish a simple app. I had published an older version of SportsIn back in 2020 (?) and I don't recall it being so challenging.

For instance, now Google requires to have 20 (!) people to test your application **before** it goes public. I see where they are coming from (more quality on applications, less junk apps).
However, it is not great.

## Sport

We're preparing the championship play-off which will be in about 1 month. It's now or never: either we win and head to the final, or we lose and go for the 3rd/4th place.
